GSP420 CAGE Engine
==================
The project files have been updated to VS2012 which supports many of the C++11 features. If you have VS2010, you should still be able to open the solution. To build however, you need to change the toolset to v100 by right-clicking on the project "-> Configuration Properties -> General" and set "Platform Toolset" to "Visual Studio 2010 (v100)".
